Flowchart for Dragon Realm
It often helps to write down everything you want your game or program to do before you start writing code. When you do this, you are designing the program.

For example, it may help to draw a flowchart. A flowchart is a diagram that shows every possible action that can happen in the game and which actions are connected. Figure 5-1 is a flowchart for Dragon Realm.

To see what happens in the game, put your finger on the START box. Then follow one arrow from that box to another box. Your finger is like the program execution. The program terminates when your finger lands on the END box.
